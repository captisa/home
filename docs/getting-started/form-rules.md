# Form Rules

You can create form rules and recommendations to apply form logic without writing JavaScript code. Form rules provide a simple interface to implement commonly used rules. By combining conditions and actions, you can do the following with form rules:
Set field value based on formula, value from another field, and constant value

- Clear field values
- Make field required
- Show or hide fields
- Enable or disable fields
- Validate data and show error messages
- Change field instructions
